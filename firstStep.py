# The first step is to uncomment one code from line 12-16 below
# The second step is to make sure no program is running
# The third step is to run client.py
# The fourth step is to run server.py or silentServer.py
# Repeat these four steps to see how the outcome file changes in different cases

# Select input_correct.txt, client will send correct messages, so server will reply ACK
# Select input_wrong files, client will send wrong messages, so server will reply reject
# Run client.py and server.py in order, client will receive response
# Run client.py and silentServer.py in order, client won't receive response

# fileName = 'input_correct.txt'
# fileName = 'input_wrong1.txt'
# fileName = 'input_wrong2.txt'
fileName = 'input_wrong3.txt'
# fileName = 'input_wrong4.txt'
